# Project: Gene Weaver - Dazzling DNA Destiny!

**Mission:** To banish boring biology lessons and swap dry diagrams for dazzling digital displays that show schoolchildren how genetics *really* works (spoiler: it's kind of amazing).

## 1. Introduction: Unraveling the Blueprint of Fluffiness

The Ministry of Education knows that genetics can seem like alien magic involving weird letters (Bb? huh?). Staring at Punnett square diagrams doesn't exactly scream "fun science". We need a tool that makes learning about inheritance as engaging as choosing a kitten!

Enter the "Gene Weaver" project. The Ministry requires an interactive application where kids can play genetic matchmaker (initially with simplified traits like animal coat color) and instantly see the likely results. Imagine clicking 'Black Cat' + 'White Cat' and *seeing* the chances of getting adorable black, white, or maybe even mixed kittens pop up!

Your team's quest: Build the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of Gene Weaver, making genetics visual and vibrant.

## 2. Business Requirements

The Gene Weaver application MVP must fulfill these core requirements:

1.  **Parent Trait Input:**
    * Must have a super simple way for a user (think curious kid) to set the genetic traits for two parents.
    * For the MVP, allow selecting the **genotype** for one gene (e.g., 'BB', 'Bb', 'bb'). If you opt for phenotype input (like 'Black Fur'), ensure your logic correctly maps to genotypes based on the model below. Keep it intuitive!

2.  **Genetic Model Implementation:**
    * Must accurately crunch the numbers behind the scenes using basic Mendelian genetics (see Core Model) to figure out the probable genetic makeup of the offspring. This is the "science bit".

3.  **Offspring Visualization (The Star of the Show!):**
    * This is where the magic happens! The results absolutely *must* be visually engaging and instantly understandable for children. We're talking **maximum clarity, minimum boredom**.
    * Forget raw data tables. Think **colorful graphics**, clear labels, maybe even **cute icons** (Fluffy kittens? Spotty puppies? Potted plants? Your artistic flair is welcome!). The visualization MUST clearly show:
        * The predicted ratios/probabilities of offspring **genotypes** (e.g., "25% BB", "50% Bb", "25% bb").
        * The resulting predicted ratios/probabilities of offspring **phenotypes** (e.g., "Looks like 75% chance of Black Kittens!", "25% chance of White Kittens!").
    * **Crucially:** Make it pop! This isn't a PhD defense submission; it's meant to spark curiosity and make kids go "Cool!", not induce quiet contemplation (or naps).

4.  **Interactive Experimentation:**
    * Users should be able to click around, easily change Mom's and Dad's traits, and see the outcome change instantly. Click, see, learn!

5.  **MVP Scope:**
    * Nail the visualization for **one single gene** showing **simple dominance**. Get this right before adding complexity.

6.  **Technology Agnosticism:**
    * Use whatever tech stack floats your team's boat (or builds the best visualizer!).
    * Web app (frontend only? frontend + backend?), desktop app â€“ all valid options.
    * Keep it achievable for the MVP. No need for databases unless tackling stretch goals.

## 3. Core Genetic Model (MVP)

Implement inheritance for a single gene, two alleles, simple Mendelian dominance.

**Example Scenario (Simplified Cat Coat Color):**

* **Gene:** Controls basic coat color.
* **Alleles:** `B` (Dominant, Black fur), `b` (Recessive, white fur).
* **Genotypes -> Phenotypes:** `BB` -> Black Fur, `Bb` -> Black Fur, `bb` -> White Fur.
* **User Input:** Select genotypes for Parent 1 (`BB`, `Bb`, `bb`) and Parent 2 (`BB`, `Bb`, `bb`).
* **Calculation Logic:** Implement Punnett Square logic. (e.g., `Bb` x `Bb` -> 25% `BB`, 50% `Bb`, 25% `bb`).
* **Output Visualization:** Show phenotype probabilities based on the calculation (e.g., 75% Black Fur, 25% White Fur).

## 4. Expected Outcome & Deliverables

Each team needs to:

1.  Deliver a functional Gene Weaver MVP application meeting the requirements.
2.  Present a brief (5-10 min) demo:
    * Show off the user interface and how easy it is to use.
    * Run through a few different parent combinations.
    * **Highlight the visualization:** Show us how clearly and engagingly it presents the genetic outcomes for the target audience.
    * Briefly mention the tech stack chosen.

## 5. Stretch Goals (Optional - Go Wild If You Have Time!)

* **Level Up the Genetics:** Implement co-dominance/incomplete dominance (Pink flowers from Red + White?). Tackle two genes (dihybrid cross - conquer the 9:3:3:1 ratio!).
* **Seriously Awesome Visuals:** Ditch generic blocks! Use actual icons (cats, dogs, flowers, peas...). Maybe simple animations? Make it delightful!
* **Save Your Creations:** Allow users to save cool scenarios they've set up.
* **Explain It Like I'm Five:** Add super simple text explaining *why* the results look the way they do.

## 6. How to Get Started (Workshop Instructions)

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Create your project files (code, UI designs, etc.) within your cloned repository.
3.  Collaborate with your team using standard Git practices (push, pull, merge like pros!).
4.  Build the Gene Weaver application, focusing on nailing that core logic and visual output for the MVP.
5.  Commit your code regularly and prepare for your dazzling presentation!
